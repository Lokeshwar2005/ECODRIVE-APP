# ECODRIVE-APP

##Introduction

In an era increasingly focused on sustainability and smart technology, encouraging eco-conscious
habits through digital platforms has become essential. Eco Drive is an innovative Android-based
application designed to promote greener driving practices by tracking trips, analyzing eco-
performance, and rewarding users for fuel-efficient behavior. Built with user engagement and
modern Android development principles, Eco Drive offers an intuitive, gamified experience that
empowers users to make environmentally responsible choices.

At its core, Eco Drive utilizes real-time location tracking, Firebase services, and intelligent data
visualization to provide users with a comprehensive understanding of their driving patterns. The
app features seamless fragment-based navigation, a responsive dashboard interface, and interactive
charts that reflect daily eco progress. Through smart algorithms and Firebase Firestore integration,
Eco Drive evaluates eco-driving performance and translates it into meaningful metrics like eco-
points, badges, and fuel savings.

Eco Drive integrates Firebase Authentication to support secure sign-in via email or Google
accounts, while Firestore ensures reliable data storage and real-time updates. Users can track their
previous trips, view map-based summaries, and monitor their badge progress — all while engaging
with personalized tips and rewards that reinforce good driving habits.

Developed in Kotlin and aligned with Material Design 3 standards, Eco Drive guarantees a smooth
and visually cohesive experience across all modern Android devices. This document presents the
Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for Eco Drive, detailing its purpose, core
functionalities, architecture, and design objectives. The goal is to deliver a transformative mobile
experience that promotes sustainability through technology, motivation, and intelligent feedback.
